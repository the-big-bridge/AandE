        <p>Despite my initial expectations, I have gained many new insights from this reading. The discussion on songbirds, although not personally of great interest to me regarding the evolution and origins of language, seems to captivate the academic community. It appears that multilingualism and sign language are also subjects of intense investigation.</p>

        <p>The debate between domain general and domain-specific aspects of language is also fascinating, and the conclusions reached are thought-provoking. This is the type of information that I crave—something I would never have been able to discover on my own. Additionally, the hypothesis of "less is more" in language learning caught my attention.</p>

        <p>At times, the reading veers into the realm of hopelessly philosophical questions, such as contemplating the experience of color by a blind person through synesthesia as they hear notes from a piano. It raises the perplexing issue of how we can experience something that does not originate from our reality.</p>

        <p>One thing I am certain of is that I will learn sign language someday. But for now, I am focusing on Greek and Latin. Afterward, I plan to tackle French, German, and perhaps Russian. Subsequently, I will explore languages unrelated to Latin and my native language, followed by sign languages and other novel linguistic endeavors. The pursuit of language learning will forever remain insatiable for me.</p>

        <p>Here are a few interesting points that I would like to highlight since I have reached mental exhaustion and struggle to provide further insights on these topics:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The "sweet spot" of Broca's area: using the end of the racket to hit the ball.</li>
            <li>The role of the suppressing network in distinguishing a monolingual brain from a multilingual brain—switching to a new language is much easier than suppressing a language.</li>
            <li>Linguistic determinism.</li>
            <li>Honorifics: the embedded awareness of social hierarchy within language.</li>
            <li>Do we see color because we have a name for it or because we have a social necessity to see it?</li>
            <li>Wittgenstein's perspective: Language is a form of life, highlighting the influence of philosophers on scientific inquiry.</li>
            <li>Therapy as the replacement of old stories with new ones.</li>
            <li><mark>Whenever we attempt to strengthen a connection, we inadvertently distort the very thing we are trying to connect with. </mark> </li>
            (The last two points delved into philosophical territory, which may seem out of place for a linguistic class, but they are still noteworthy.)
        </ul>

        <p>I have nothing more to add regarding this reading. However, I am considering taking on another reading on linguistics in the near future to expand my knowledge in the field.</p>
