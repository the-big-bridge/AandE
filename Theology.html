            I am delighted that I decided to read theology. It is informative and introduces fresh perspectives.

            To be honest, I didn't enjoy the subject initially. I saw it as a random collection of ideas that made no sense. However, I now realize that theology is similar to language in that it appears random but still possesses beauty and value. Interestingly, I began to appreciate it when I started taking it seriously. It is a field of study focused on the divine, yet it remains profoundly human. In fact, one could argue that it is more human than any other discipline. It predates enlightenment, science, and industrialization.

            I admire how theologians approach their religion with such seriousness. They spend time contemplating, writing theses, and engaging in debates with other theologians. It fascinates me how they identify inconsistencies within Christianity and invent new doctrines to explain them. I appreciate that they question the oppressive and dogmatic nature of the church and turn to scripture for new interpretations. The intricate development of theology captivates me. It originated with missionaries traveling across continents, establishing churches and gathering believers. Then Augustine, a young man who found solace for his restless heart in God, brought about significant changes. Thomas Aquinas impressively used logic to attempt to reconcile Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic doctrines. When the Protestants separated from the Catholics, they further divided into Lutherans and Calvinists. As time went on, more branches emerged, and they criticized one another. Now, even the new Pope is seeking advice to update the church and unite its divided factions.

            I used to think that religion was simply blind belief, determined by one's upbringing. I believed it was mostly external, merely a matter of performing rituals. Or I thought people were ignorant and foolish, blindly following beliefs without questioning them. How mistaken I was! It is inherent in our nature to seek understanding, especially when it comes to important matters like salvation. This course has helped me realize my errors. I hesitate to say it, but I think theology is growing on me. I might even delve deeper into this subject.

            I once thought that religion was fading away. However, I discovered that only two presidents of the United States were not Christians. That fact astonished me. We have had a black president, nearly had a female president, and people from diverse backgrounds, yet never a Muslim or a Hinduist. Furthermore, I learned that the majority of religious people in the US are not only Christians but also Protestants. Roman Catholics constitute the second-largest group. About 30 percent identify as atheist, agnostic, or followers of other religions. I was truly amazed by the continuing influence of Christianity even in the year 2023.

            Now, I would like to highlight some concepts I have learned and still find fascinating. It is worth noting that Jesus was a Jew and spoke Aramaic, while the Gospels were written in Greek. The formation and teaching of doctrines required substantial effort. It took time for these doctrines to become central to Christian life. Concepts such as the Trinity, Incarnation, and Grace underwent extensive debates. Most intriguingly, there is the doctrine of incomprehensibility. The significance of the doctrine of atonement wasn't initially apparent to me, but now I understand it. I was surprised to discover that the notion of the soul emerged relatively late. The idea that one immediately goes to hell after death is also perplexing. Similarly, the concept of heaven as a physical place above is intriguing. Additionally, the "solas" of grace, scripture, and faith, and the debate surrounding the physical presence of the body of Christ in the bread, raise thought-provoking questions. The issue of whether deceased infants go to hell, heaven, or a place called limbo (the margins) is puzzling. Similarly, the problem of original sin and the ability to perceive, reach, or understand God provoke contemplation. The role of free will in all of this is another question that arises. Does the fall serve the purpose of election, or was election necessary after the fall? How should we interpret the miracles and mythical stories in the New Testament? To what extent should we take them literally? The question of certainty in salvation and what justifies it also persists. The quietists, without a doubt, form a highly interesting branch. Is that the kind of religious life we desire? Lastly, how can we sustain Christianity and strive for unity among its various branches?

            <mark>These problems continue to trouble me even as an observer. For a true believer, it must be maddening.</mark>
