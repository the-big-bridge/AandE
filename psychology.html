        <p>Recent reading reminded me of the vastness of the subject.</p>

        <p>Psychology encompasses the study of human nature, which includes neuroscience, epistemology, religious studies, behaviorism, psychiatry, linguistics, and every other subject related to humans. Although politics and philosophy may not readily embrace this inclusion, strictly speaking, they should. Figures like Hume, Watson, Freud, Yang, and Lacum recognized themselves as psychologists.</p>
        
        <p>Psychology emerged from philosophy around a century ago, and since then, it has aligned itself with the scientific method. It has undergone reforms, grappling with the balance between focusing too much or too little on the mind. It has faced scrutiny and received praise. Perhaps the best way to understand what psychology has become is to divide it into distinct branches and refrain from using the term "psychology" outside of library catalogs. By doing so, we can avoid confusion and futile debates. Branches of psychology that pose different questions, employ different approaches, adopt different methodologies, and respect different types of conclusions should not be lumped together. I hesitate to make any further generalizations about this subject.</p>

            Now that I recognize how little I truly know about psychology, I want to discuss a few points that I found noteworthy and share some additional thoughts.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            One point raised by a professor [Dan Robinson] I found online, which I am somewhat doubtful about, is the idea that even if a subject's behavior can be predicted, it does not negate the existence of free will. This concept deserves a place on my list of Intellectual Ideas I Need to Think About, although I must admit I do not possess such a list, and even if I did, I am uncertain if I would be any better at addressing this question and providing an answer. There may be a counterargument against this claim that needs to be explored, but perhaps the nature of free will itself should be thoroughly examined. Or maybe my hesitation stems from the fact that I hold the professor in such high regard, making it challenging to dismiss his claim and move on effortlessly.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Another point of interest is the psychology of the empty organism, represented by the abbreviation "B of O" for behaviorism. The ongoing debate between behaviorism and psychoanalysis reminds me of the historical disputes in metaphysics, such as idealism versus materialism or empiricism versus rationalism. <mark>It is amusing how different branches of intellectual history mimics each other among branches.</mark>  I am inclined to embrace this idea, much like my affinity for empiricism and materialism.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Lastly, the five stages of moral development were incredibly enjoyable to learn about. The concept of the shared form of life, Darwin's unconventional perspective, and Aristotle's insights on how gestation determines biological sexâ€”these ideas will linger with me in one way or another.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Undoubtedly, the journey was worth it.
