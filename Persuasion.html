        <p>Persuasion is about shaping a statement in others' minds as you desire.</p>

        <p>A statement refers to a judgment toward something, such as "My window is squared" or "Your dress is beautiful."</p>

        <p>The building blocks required for different types of statements vary, so I divide them into two categories:</p>

        <p><span>Subjective Experience </span> <br> These are experiences that are unique to individuals.</p>

        <p><span>Objective Experience </span> <br> These are experiences that are universal to everyone.</p>

        <p><span>Intellectual Statement</span><br>
        Constructed by: Logic + Objective experience<br>
        Examples: "My window is squared," "All bachelors are unmarried men."</p>

        <p><span>Instinctual Statement</span><br>
        Constructed by: Logic + Subjective experience<br>
        Examples: "Love is holy," "God exists."</p>

        <p>(These categories relate to Hume's Fork: All analytical statements are intellectual, while some synthetic statements are intellectual.)</p>

        <p>I categorize the state of being persuaded into two types:</p>

        <p><span>Intellectual persuasion</span> <br> When someone's consciousness believes it.</p>
        <p><span>Instinctual persuasion</span> <br> When someone's subconsciousness believes it.</p>

        <p>Now, we can have four situations:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Persuading someone intellectually with an intellectual statement.</li>
            <li>Persuading someone intellectually with an instinctual statement.</li>
            <li>Persuading someone instinctually with an intellectual statement.</li>
            <li>Persuading someone instinctually with an instinctual statement.</li>
            
        </ol>
          

        <p>Therefore, the method you need to employ to achieve each of the above goals is solely related to how the persuasion is received and has nothing to do with the nature of the statement itself.</p>

        <p><span>Methods you need</span><br>
        For situations 1 and 2: Logic/Reasoning + Objective Experience<br>
        For situations 3 and 4: (Logic) + Subjective Experience</p>

        <p>Regarding experience, whether objective or subjective, you can either create new experiences for the person you want to persuade or evoke existing experiences from their memory.</p>

        <p><mark>Only Subjective Experience can persuade the reptile brain.</mark></p>

        <p>Based on the above, I draw two conclusions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The best way to persuade people is to tell them stories rather than just presenting data.</li>
            <li>Most, if not all, of humanity's statements are instinctual. We are more animalistic than we tend to believe, and our rationality is limited.</li>
        </ul>
          

        <p><span>Expanding on conclusion 2</span></p>

        <p>Why do we have instinctual statements?</p>

        <p>We develop them through long and stimulating subjective experiences. Sometimes, these experiences are referred to as trauma or the collective unconsciousness.</p>

        <p>Now, let's discuss how these persuaded states can change.</p>

        <p><span>Situation 1: Instinctual → Intellectual</span></p>

        <p>It is almost irresistible when the former (instinctual state) is powerful enough. Sometimes people may defend themselves using reason, which can mislead them into believing that their statements are intellectual. However, these statements can still be persuaded with reason once individuals realize that their statements were guided by instincts, and they recognize them as pseudo-intellectual statements.</p>

        <p><span>Situation 2: Intellectual → Instinctual</span></p>

        <p>When instincts resist being persuaded, individuals are likely to be defensive and avoid exposing their minds to any experiences that might support a different statement. It is common for people to protect their original beliefs. Achieving an intellectual-to-instinctual shift requires subjective experience, but it can aid the persuasion process if individuals are willing to seek out subjective experiences. It's important to remember that the mind can become defensive.</p>
