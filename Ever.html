        <p>If I ever write about philosophy, I will make it enjoyable.</p>
        <p>My words will either be moving and sublime, feels like California sunshine;</p>
        <p><mark>or it will be deep and savoring, tastes like structured fine wine.</mark></p>
        <p>Whenever I can express myself in one hundred words, I will not torture anyone with one hundred and one;</p>
        <p>Because I remember how I read Hegel and Kant, it could have been a lot more fun.</p>
        <p>I live in the heyday of modernity, an explosion of diversity, those and some more details I will put in the preface;</p>
        <p>Saving the scholars some effort of guessing what influence I am under, and myself some reface.</p>
        <p>Every author is a dead author, so they cannot get mad.</p>
        <p>When one finishes oneâ€™s work, one should let them talk.</p>
