                <p>The rain is not a rain, it is a conference.</p>
                <p>The sound it makes is water’s language.</p>
                <p>They have traveled from north to south,</p>
                <p>And now they are sharing their stories.</p>

                <br>
                <p>This one has been in champaign glasses,</p>
                <p>That one has been in New York’s sewer,</p>
                <p>This one has been the saliva shared by lovers,</p>
                <p>That one has been the tear of a mother.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Every one of them is passionate,</p>
                <p>They cannot wait to share their story,</p>
                <p>They all speak together,</p>
                <p>Then it became lyrics.</p>

                <br>
                <p>People stand under the roof,</p>
                <p>Annoyed and complaining,</p>
                <p><mark>They heard the entire rain,</mark></p>
                <p><mark>But understood nothing.</mark></p>
