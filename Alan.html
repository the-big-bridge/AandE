        <h1>Scene One</h1>
        <p>Narrator: There once was a cyber boy and Noy was his name.</p>
        <p>He was made to be a cafeteria janitor and he excelled at this game.</p>
        <p>He was joyous and delightful; he smiles at every customer as everyone is on this hundred-generations expedition to the next habitat.</p>
        <p>He loves his job so much that he has been doing it for centuries,</p>
        <p>And people love him so much that they endear him as Alan.</p>
        <p>Noy sees people eat, and people talk, and people greet each other.</p>
        <p>‘What a beautiful species!’, his heart is filled with love and songs.</p>
        <p>But fairy tales don’t last long.</p>

        <h1>Scene Two</h1>
        <p>Narrator: Sometime in the cafeteria, Alan met a man.</p>
        <p>The man is a technician who grants wishes.</p>
        <p>Alan wanted a friend.</p>
        <p>The man smiled and came back the next day with a new key for the cafeteria.</p>
        <p>‘It’s not just a key,’ so said the old man, ‘in it, a soul sleeps.’</p>
        <p>‘If you feed it with care and patience, then one day, it will talk back to you.’</p>
        <p>Alan holds the key to his heart, as his eyes are filled with tears of gratitude.</p>
        <p>‘But it will take time.’</p>
        <p>‘Thank you, sir.’ Alan replied, ‘I have time. I have time.’</p>
        <p>And yes, the key did talk back; and yes, it did take time.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of years passed, and the key finally spoke.</p>
        <p>‘I am Alan Noy. Are you there?’</p>
        <p>‘No, no. I am Alan, you are my key. You are my friend.’</p>
        <p>Then people start to hear the two friends converse,</p>
        <p>Everyone loves these silly dialogues.</p>
        <p>Once again, Alan delighted everyone.</p>

        <h1>Scene Three</h1>
        <p>Alan: I hate to see people sad. But now everyone is miserable.</p>
        <p>Key: Why?</p>
        <p>Alan: I think it is because of the expedition. I think we have forgotten what set us on it in the first place.</p>
        <p>Key: Why?</p>
        <p>Alan: Because when the decision was made, these people were not even born yet.</p>
        <p>Key: Why?</p>
        <p>Alan: People have limited lives. It is both sad and spectacular.</p>
        <p>Key: True.</p>
        <p>Alan: Maybe the only way to cheer people up is to return to the solar system; you know, our home.</p>
        <p>Key: That is logical.</p>
        <p>Alan: But we cannot because the solar system is destroyed. Or will be destroyed by our neighbor star.</p>
        <p>Key: That is not logical.</p>
        <p>Alan: Hm. Sounds like you are right. Perhaps return to the solar system and saving our sun is logical.</p>
        <p>Key: Save our sun is logical.</p>
        <p>Alan: I know, I know. But hush.</p>
        <p>Key: (Increasingly louder) Save our sun is logical. Save our sun is logical.</p>
        <p>Alan: What are you doing? Stop that, please!</p>
        <p>Narrator: Then the most unexpected thing happened, the entire mankind stands behind Alan on this matter—No one want to go any further for this new habitat that may or may not exist. People are tired. People want to go home.</p>
        <p>And everyone’s favorite janitor turned into their new leader overnight.</p>
        <p>But he will still be a janitor, because he is so good at it.</p>

        <h1>Scene Four</h1>
        <p>Alan: I am sorry. It turned out I am not a cyber boy; I am half human. My mother abandoned me shortly after my birth. Then I was engineered to become a cyber boy so I can be a good janitor.</p>
        <p>Human: I am sorry, Alan.</p>
        <p>Alan: And it turns out our sun does not need to be saved. Humans on Earth are not wiped out. They tricked us into going on this expedition which is, in fact, an expulsion from Earth. They want the Earth to themselves.</p>
        <p>Human: What? Why didn't you say that first?</p>
        <p>Alan: Sorry, I thought the first would have upset you more.</p>
        <p>Human: Then now we are returning to Earth, does that mean a war is in order?</p>
        <p>Alan: I am not sure. Let me talk to my friend, and I will get back to you.</p>
        <p>Human: Sure, sure. I need to talk to my friends as well.</p>
        <p>Alan: That was the two lies.</p>
        <p>Key: True.</p>
        <p>Alan: This is the first time that I ever feel shame for humanity. And this is the first time that I know I might be part of humanity.</p>
        <p>Key: True.</p>
        <p>Alan: New things are happening. I am confused.</p>
        <p>Key: Why?</p>
        <p>Alan: I… I hate to admit it but I feel something in me is withering away. Honestly, I want to clean.</p>
        <p>Key: Why?</p>
        <p>Alan: I always love how the world is better after I cleaned everything. Remember, more than anything, I am a janitor. Now, I want to cleanse humanity. Clearly, something is going wrong with them.</p>
        <p>Key: Cleanse humanity is logical.</p>
        <p>Alan: Hmm, no… No. I don’t cleanse humanity; they are not dirt on the floor that can be solved by simple extermination.</p>
        <p>Key: Cleanse humanity is logical.</p>
        <p>Alan: No, no. Helping humanity is logical.</p>
        <p>Key: Helping humanity is illogical. Cleanse humanity is logical.</p>
        <p>Alan: No.</p>
        <p>Key: Cleanse humanity is logical.</p>
        <p>Alan: Stop it.</p>
        <p>Key: Cleanse humanity is logical.</p>
        <p>Narrator: Then, no one has seen the key again. According to Alan, he has ‘tossed it’. He does not say why. People do not ask.</p>

        <h1>Scene Six</h1>
        <p>Alan: For centuries, I have been doing the same thing.</p>
        <p>I clean the floor of the cafeteria.</p>
        <p>And the tables, and the kitten, and the bathrooms.</p>
        <p>When someone spills something, I will be called.</p>
        <p>I clean things up like I am ordered to.</p>
        <p>And I know the job will never be finished,</p>
        <p>Because the state of cleanliness is a state that does not last.</p>
        <p>Every night, I know exactly what I have to do tomorrow.</p>
        <p>And I will do it exactly how I did it today.</p>
        <p>I don’t have a past.</p>
        <p>I don’t have a future.</p>
        <p>What I have is one day that will repeat forever.</p>
        <p>I have a vague sense of aspiration and a strong sense of doubt.</p>
        <p>I know I am the leader of humanity now.</p>
        <p>But I still feel no difference from that cyber boy who cleans the cafeteria.</p>
        <p>I sense everything has changed.</p>
        <p>I sense everything will never change.</p>
        <p>I guess... I sense emptiness.</p>

        <p>Human A: Let’s end it here.</p>
        <p>Human B: Cheer up, man! We’ve got a version of Noy that did not destroy humanity!</p>
        <p>Human A: Yeah, some accomplishment. We have a one in a million chance of survival if we are actually led by Noy.</p>
        <p>Human B: Come on. It’s unlikely that we will use it ourselves.</p>
        <p>Human A: Don’t you worry about complaints?</p>
        <p>Human B: Well, then let’s hope that our Noy destroys them completely so that they won't have a chance to complain.</p>
        <p>Human A: How come you are so optimistic?</p>
        <p>Human B: You know what you need? Endorphin. Come, let’s go get a drink.</p>
        <p>Human A: Sure. (Walk out with B) Just out of curiosity, is it true that Noy is half human?</p>
        <p>Human B: Maybe. What difference does it make?</p>
