                <p>You know how we all sometimes doubt whether everything was real, whether I am still dreaming?</p>
                <p>But we never asked twice, because of the ridicules from friends or from ourselves.</p>
                <p>If you want to peek through the demon's window and see the other side of truth, well then, I got a story for you.</p>

                <h><mark>E.2</mark></h>
                <p>It was Thursday morning, I kissed my son Mason goodbye, I drank a cup of tea handed by my wife Selina, and off I went to work.</p>
                <p>On the bus, Dan and I were catching up.</p>
                <p>'Hey, pal, how's Selina?'</p>
                <p>'Really, top of your head is Selina?'</p>
                <p>'Don't kid me, Leo, Selina has been yours since she first came to our school.'</p>
                <p>'Back to our 13th, eh?' I replied, suddenly, a weird but also majestic feeling welled up in my chest, 'I sometimes feel like this is all a dream, you know, when I wake up, I'd be still a 13-year-old young chap.'</p>
                <p>Dan looked amazed, 'So... you are saying you are dreaming now?'</p>
                <p>I looked out of the window, it's a cloudy dime sky without any inspiring sunlight, I can almost see the piles of documents for today and hear my fight with Selina about who ought to wash the dishes tonight.</p>
                <p>'Don't be silly,' Dan said.</p>
                <p>'I am not.'</p>
                <p>Dan looked at me sarcastically, 'Prove it.'</p>
                <p>'Okay,' I said with a smile, because of Dan's words of encouragement. I dashed to the bus front door, knocked it open and I was dumped out by the bus at a flying speed.</p>
                <p>Just so you know, I am not crazy.</p>
                <p>I just really trust my instincts, and that's not the first time my instincts told me the so-called 'reality' is all bullshit, I just respect the beauty of this 'reality' too much to break it.</p>
                <p>But that day, I suddenly had enough.</p>

                
                <br>

    
                <h><mark>E.3</mark></h>
                <p>Guess where I woke up?</p>
                <p>My bed. Ha, wasn't a hospital bed, (sorry, physics)</p>
                <p>'Time to go to work, Leo.' It's Selina calling.</p>
                <p>'Hon... What day is today?'</p>
                <p>'Thursdays.'</p>
                <p>My friend, have you heard of it? I was right all along, there's no reality!</p>
                <p>'So, Selina, why do you lie to me?'</p>
                <p>'...Leo?'</p>
                <p>'If there's no reality, then you must be fake.'</p>
                <p>'Leo... Do we really have to do this... again?'</p>
                <p>'Selina, you knew it all along, right? Since I met you when we were 13th, it's been 22 years.'</p>
                <p>Selina wouldn't answer my question, in fact, she wouldn't even look at me, she just kept stuffing me the cup of standard tea.</p>
                <p>'Answer the question!' I poured the tea on her, all over her hair, lips, and clothes.</p>
                <p>There, I did it, the thing I was too scared to do for 22 years, but today is the day of courage!</p>
                <p>Selina gazed at me for a while, surprisingly, without any anger, but... calmness. She wiped the stain off her peacefully, 'Leo, you cannot move on today, can you?'</p>
                <p>I looked back, 'No.' Excitement pulses through my veins because I know the truth is on the way.</p>




               
          
                <br>

                <h><mark>E.4</mark></h>
                <p>Then Selina told me all about it. I hardly remember any because she is going really fast and I hardly even care to follow.</p>
                <p>It's something... like, race war, lethal bomb, humanity extinction, new epoch, solitude civilization, circulation stuff... So hazy, I am even sure I got those nuns right.</p>
                <p>And she said the whole 'reality' is actually the same thing, or should I say running by the same one, the CPU, and it plays Infinite loop, so it isn't my first time.</p>
                <p>'So, who is controlling the reality 'reality' now?</p>
                <p>Maybe, some alien race, like I am their subject? Or, some superhuman, oh, are my Marvel movie tickets finally going to pay off?'</p>
                <p>'...Sure,' Selina replied, 'if you are your own super valiant.'</p>
                <p>'Me?' Stupefied.</p>
                <p>'Yeah, I just told you, it's a solitude civilization.'</p>
                <p>'You can't be serious; I design all those nonsense just to kid myself?'</p>
                <p>Selina grinned, 'Well, you designed me, and I am a doll, so don't beat yourself up.'</p>
                <p>Holy... cow.</p>
                <p>I did?</p>



                
                <br>

                <h><mark>E.5</mark></h>
                <p>Well... Turns out I did all the things to myself, programmed the CPU to do, a long long time ago.</p>
                <p>Turns out all the deity calling I did when I was beat up by my mom, having sex with my fantasy girlfriend or almost lost my job because of a loophole, was to myself. I am my own God, the worst joke ever and now it's happening.</p>
                <p>'Selina, I got to talk to myself.'</p>
                <p>'Well... Actually, we can restore your memory back, so you can understand yourself, but talking to yourself is...'</p>
                <p>'Then get those goddamned memories in!' interrupted, outraged. Cannot really tell why, but I am just really angry about the reality. Reality is still no reality, the truth of all, is a maddening void.</p>
                <p>'Leo, before you decide anything, we got a letter for you, it's from the one you want to talk to.'</p>
                <p>I snatched the letter and opened it, hey, it's written in my favorite calligraphy.</p>



               
                <br>
              


                <h><mark>E.6</mark></h>
                <p>The letter read:</p>
                <p>Hello, Leo.</p>
                <p>Sorry for all the unpleasant moments of your life.</p>
                <p>I did pretty much arrange everything for you, but this time, you will have the freedom back. The CPU is yours now. Do whatever you want with it. Now reality is in your hands, have fun.</p>
                <p>P. S. : Don't have your memory all back, okay? It's for the best.</p>
                <p>Loved, Leon•W•McHale</p>
                <p>Well... Should take advice from yourself, right? Not to mention I own the CPU now, memory can wait.</p>
                <p>So, what's first? Oh, tell Dan he is a terrible boss and how his Jenny always hits on me.</p>



                
                <br>
               

                <h><mark>E.7</mark></h>
                <p>I am done. I need no memory to understand why I did what I did to myself. The program is actually perfect, not a single symbol is unnecessary.</p>
                <p>Humans can only eat 3 times a day, only got that much taste buds, only got one cock and less horny each time you had it, and after the tasty meals and boundaryless sex feasts, what's left is... inky darkness consuming my inside, the emptiness, the sense of lost...</p>
                <p>I can lie to myself no more, I miss my Mason, I miss my Selina, not this Selina, the ordinary bossy caring wife Selina.</p>
                <p>'Hon.' I had my head against many glamorous celebrities' tits, and struggled to stand up.</p>
                <p>'Yes.' Selina aside, replied calmly as always.</p>
                <p>'I want to go back.'</p>
                <p>Selina smiled and kissed me on my forehead, 'Sure, Leo.'</p>



              
                <br>
              

                <h><mark>E.8</mark></h>
                <p>It was Thursday morning, I kissed Mason goodbye, I drank a cup of tea handed by Selina, and off I went to work.</p>
                <p>On the bus, Dan and I were catching up.</p>
                <p>‘Hey, pal, how's Selina?‘</p>
                <p>‘Really, top of your head is Selina?’</p>
                <p>‘Don't kid me, Leo, Selina has been yours since she first came to our school.‘</p>
                <p>‘Back to our 13th, eh?’ I replied, suddenly, a weird but also majestic feeling welled up in my chest, ‘I sometimes feel like this is all a dream, you know, when I wake up, I'd be still a 13 year-old young chap.‘</p>
                <p>Dan looked amazed, ‘So... you are saying you are dreaming now?’</p>
                <p>I looked out of the window, it's a beautiful crystal clear sky without any depressing clouds, I can almost smell the delicious lunch today and watched the amusing TV show tonight.</p>
                <p>‘Don't be silly.’ Dan said.</p>
                <p>‘Yeah... you are probably right.’</p>
