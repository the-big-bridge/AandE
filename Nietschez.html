        I was shocked by Nietsche when I read him because it’s a totally different way of viewing things. I guess this is the learning process, it keeps rescuing you from more and more sophisticated mindsets, which will eventually take you to a thinking framework with horrifying flexibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike many other philosophers, the question Nietsche is asking is about life. And the answer can’t be reached by reasoning. Rationality, the cage humanity has put themselves in for centuries, is certainly not what life is all about. Nietsche attacked many great thinkers, like Socrates and Aristotle, because they try to rationalize everything. What he is trying to say is that this is impossible. We were exaggerating the power of rationality—it isn’t the solution to everything, much less the center of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        So…is it God? Nietsche then attacks Christianity for several reasons. The essential one is this: Christianity is trying to make life all about God. It dehumanizes us. It robbed us of our self-esteem, it took away what belongs to us, like wisdom and virtue; it denies our chance to appreciate the world we live in and makes us ignore the beauty of reality. It tainted many noble things, like lust and passion. We live, as humans themselves, not as what God wants us to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        We live in THIS world. We love THIS life. We must embrace reality, learning that it is beautiful enough as itself. In fact, from this view, Nietsche is far from a pessimist. Pessimists aren’t those who see the truth in life but those who try to deny or reject it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life is struggling. Life is tragic. But life is also to become yourself, to live for your passions. It is a lovely pain.

          It's said that Philosophy should answer the fundamental questions, so the argument goes,<br>
          <br>
          'So we have to start with atoms!'<br>
          <br>
          'No, we have to start with the existence of atoms!'<br>
          <br>
          Nietsche glanced at them, signed lightly and walked out the shining academic hall. He headed directly to the exit and pushed open the doors.<br>
          <br>
          He heard the birds singing, the river chanting, some young girls giggling, and an old man choking on cigarettes. He wandered through the mountains and leaped across the streams. Finally, he set down to appreciate the sunset in front of the sea.<br>
          <br>
          'Tell me,' he whispered to the wind, 'isn't the fundamental question life?'<br>
          <br>
          His back faded as centuries passed by, but the question is still haunting humanity till today, though we don't even know what it is.<br>
